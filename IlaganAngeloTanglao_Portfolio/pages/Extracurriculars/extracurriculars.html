                    <h2>Nihongo Club</h2>
                    <p>I first joined this club when I was on 7th grade and I was still new to ValMaSci. Joining this club was a fun and valuable experience. Through the interactive activities, cultural events, and group learning, I was able to improve my proficiency in Nihongo. This club offers learning opportunities through group work as well as a study session with a teacher from Japan. Not only that but this club also builds connection between members through various activities.  </p>

                    <h2>Sports Club</h2>
                    <p>Being a part of the Sports Club was a fun and interactive experience. I only joined the club in my last year at ValMaSci, and although it was a short time, I had the most fun. Joining this club gave me an opportunity to stay active while developing discipline and improving my physical fitness. More importantly, it created a lasting motivation within me to continue being active, which I do by consistently going to the gym.</p>
