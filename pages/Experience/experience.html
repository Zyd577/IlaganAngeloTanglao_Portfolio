                    <h2>Sky Intl.</h2>
                    <p>My experience as a tech support intern at Sky Intl. was hard but meaningful. The hardest part about this experience was staying awake and maintaining professionalism throughout the 8 hours of having nothing to do. I also learned about how tech supports work in a private company, but my biggest learning was self-discipline. This experience taught me to stay productive even when there's nothing to do. In the end, I understood that working as tech support means you always have to be prepared to solve problems when they arise.</p>

                    <h2>Valenzuela City Hall ICTO Office</h2>
                    <p>For my work immersion, I had the opportunity to work in the ICTO office of Valenzuela City Hall. During this experience, I was able to observe and learn what they do and how they do things in an IT environment. Although the work is not a lot, I realized that as tech support, it is better that you have nothing to do than have everything to do, because the former means that everything's working properly. Through this, I realized that as tech support, it's not only your job to fix things but also to ensure that they are stable, reliable, and will last long. </p>
